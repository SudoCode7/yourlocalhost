**What is ISC²?**

The International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium, or (ISC)2, is a non-profit organization that offers security training and certification.

(ISC)2 was founded in 1988 by a group of security organizations that wanted to create a vendor-neutral, standardized certification program to validate the competency of security professionals.




**Where does ISC² stand today?**

It is one of the biggest and most reputed organizations in the domain of cybersecurity. The certifications issued by ISC² stand tall with their reputations and are highly recognized in all the top organizations around the world.




**What is Certified in Cybersecurity?**

It is a so-called entry-level certification that will introduce you to all the scenario-based concepts of cybersecurity, if you have ever gone through CompTIA's Sec+, this should be a comparatively easy nut to crack. It is not as enduring to study for Sec+, so is the knowledge you get from it, you will surely get well versed in the concepts of how an organization functions, security controls that are to be put in place for its smooth functioning, policies, procedures, some basic laws etc.

After giving this exam, I am pretty sure, it is enduring to study for, it introduces many new concepts for a completely new beginner, but since I had finished with Sec+ previously, it didn't come as a surprise to revisit these concepts.




**How to prepare for this certification?**

To prepare for Certified in Cybersecurity, I would surely recommend going through all the material provided by ISC2 and revising from the various notes of Sec+ found, online. 

One of the major differences I was able to find was the study material provided by ISC2 and the exam questions differ a bit, to prepare well, learn everything by heart, solve all questions thoroughly given with the course material, and have a strong understanding of scenario-based questions.




**What is the exam structure?**

Since it is an physical exam, it has to be given at a Pearson-VUE exam center. It will consist of 100 MCQ questions and 120 mins with no scheduled breaks.

The passing criterion is 70% out of 1000 marks.




**What is the fee structure?**

The fee for this exam is 200$, with 50$, if you want to reschedule the exam.




**My parting words**: Learn all the material thoroughly to clear the exam with flying colors, it may look like an intro and easy cert, but it will require ***your*** enduring and consistent efforts to clear it at the end of the day, as the concepts you will find here are going to be new and mind-boggling to start with.




Prepare well and best of luck for all ur future endueavours!

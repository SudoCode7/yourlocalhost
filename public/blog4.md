## What is Cloud Computing?

At its simplest: **"Renting someone else's computer for redundancy, resources, resilience, and elasticity to perform your tasks."**  

### Key Concepts:
- **Redundancy**: The ability to recover when hardware fails or resources go down.  
- **Resources**: The capacity to upgrade computing power (RAM, storage, CPU, etc.).  
- **Resilience**: Infrastructureâ€™s ability to survive natural calamities or outages for extended periods.  
- **Elasticity**: Unlike on-premise data centers, cloud systems can scale resources up or down based on usage and cost optimization.  

This flexibility ensures that platforms like Instagram, Facebook, or Amazon can operate 24/7 without interruptions.

## How I Prepared

### Study Timeline:
I dedicated 2.5 months, but with extra hours, you can achieve this in 1.5â€“2 months.

1. **Start with one comprehensive resource**:  
   Whether itâ€™s Udemy, YouTube, or a book, pick a single resource to build your foundational knowledge. Preview various options to find what works best for your learning style.

2. **Re-revision**:  
   Regularly revise the material to reinforce concepts and clarify doubts. Use Google to resolve any confusion.

3. **Mock Exams**:  
   Practice extensively after completing the syllabus. Mock tests reveal gaps in knowledge and help refine your understanding of AWS services.

4. **Think Practically**:  
   While studying, adopt a problem-solving approach. For example, consider what AWS service youâ€™d use to meet a clientâ€™s needs for cost-effectiveness and performance.

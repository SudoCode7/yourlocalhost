# The Complete Laptop Upgradation Guide

It’s been a long time since we bought our computer. The current situation is that it has become quite slow, with dust clogging the fans (visible from the outside). Perhaps some keys are non-functional, and the trackpad feels loose. Such a dire state might tempt us to buy a new machine, but hold up! Let me give you three reasons why upgrading your current machine is better than buying a new one:

1. **Longevity**: The average lifespan of a laptop for day-to-day tasks is at least 7–8 years, and for professional workflows, it’s around 4–5 years. This means a few small upgrades can keep your machine running smoothly.  
2. **Sustainability**: By upgrading, you extend your laptop’s life and contribute to saving the environment. Otherwise, it might end up in a landfill, even if sent to an electronics refurbishing center.  
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Upgrading saves you a ton of money! Selling an old laptop typically won’t recover even half of its original cost.  

Laptops are unique machines with commonly available and easily swappable parts. To embark on this journey, you’ll need three prerequisites:

1. A calm mind and a curious nature.  
2. Upgradable parts (discussed further below).  
3. A screwdriver set to open up the machine.

### Getting Started

Start by gathering basic information about your laptop. On **Windows**, go to the *About Your PC* section; on **Mac**, navigate to *About This Mac*. Here, you’ll find essential details like RAM, processor, and GPU information.  

It’s strongly recommended to download your laptop’s manual from the manufacturer’s website. Search for it using the serial number or model name. This manual will guide you on which parts are swappable.

### Upgrade Options

#### 1. RAM
If you’re still running on 4GB of RAM, upgrade to at least 8GB (or more, depending on usage). To check your RAM consumption:
- Open the Task Manager and run your daily-use apps.  
- If RAM usage exceeds 80%, consider upgrading.  

**Notes**:  
- Ensure there’s an extra RAM slot (check your manual).  
- Buy RAM with the same frequency and manufacturer as the existing one.  

---

#### 2. Storage
If your OS boots slowly or apps take too long to load, upgrade your **hard drive** to an **SSD** (Solid State Drive). Unlike mechanical hard drives, SSDs are faster and more reliable.  

**Types of SSDs**:  
- NVMe  
- M.2  
- SATA (2.5 inch)  

Check your laptop’s compatibility and choose an SSD within your budget. Any SSD will perform significantly faster than a hard disk.

#### 3. Wi-Fi Card
Many older laptops lack 5GHz Wi-Fi support, which is crucial for faster internet speeds. If your laptop doesn’t support 5GHz, replace the Wi-Fi card. They’re affordable and easy to install.  

---

#### 4. Processor and GPU
Upgrading these is rare, as most manufacturers don’t allow it. If you’re still using an Intel Pentium processor, it’s time to replace the entire machine. For more guidance, check out my *Complete Laptop Buying Guide*.

#### 5. Battery
A degraded battery can cause poor laptop performance. Use tools like **BatteryInfoView** to check battery health. Replace it if health drops below 60%.  

---

#### 6. Thermals
Proper thermal management improves performance. Over time, thermal paste dries out, reducing heat dissipation and increasing resistance in the processor.  

- Remove the heat sink (carefully) and clean the surface using isopropyl alcohol.  
- Apply a small amount of thermal paste before reassembling.  
- Only attempt this if you feel confident, as improper handling can damage your laptop.  

---

#### 7. Keyboard
If some keys are non-functional, look for a replacement keyboard online or at local stores. Swapping the keyboard is often easier than repairing it. YouTube tutorials specific to your laptop model can help.  

---

#### 8. Cleaning and Assembly
Once you’ve acquired all the necessary parts, follow these steps:

1. **Research Disassembly**: Watch videos specific to your laptop model to understand its disassembly process (40% of the work is done here).  
2. **Organize Screws**: Place screws in an orderly manner (e.g., on a magnetic pad) to avoid confusion during reassembly.  
3. **Replace Components**: Carefully swap the parts you’re upgrading.  
4. **Clean Internals**: Use an anti-static brush to remove dust and isopropyl alcohol to clean surfaces. Avoid water.  
5. **Reassemble**: After completing the upgrades and cleaning, reattach the backplate, power on the laptop, and enjoy your upgraded machine!

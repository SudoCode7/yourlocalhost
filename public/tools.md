# Tools and Projects

I have also developed and contributed to a number of open-source projects.

#### [**Plant-Watering using Arduino**](https://github.com/SudoCode7/Plant-Watering):
Wouldn't it be interesting if you are out on a vacation and a simple hardware like arduino can water our plants working just on a powerbank for days at a time? \n /n
Indeed, this is why this project was created....!

#### [**Compare & Shop**](https://github.com/SudoCode7/Compare-Shop):
This idea had originally struck me in covid, when I was constantly looking on various grocery sites, comparing prices. Searching the same thing over and over again, this made me to write this small script.

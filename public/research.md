#### [**Accounting for the Unaccounted Vulnerabilities Found in Endpoint ISP SOHO Router**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10474274):
This paper aims to explore and discuss the extent of configuration vulnerabilities found in the new generation of pre-configured SOHO routers provided by some of the top ISPs in the country, mainly India, and many in abroad as well. The authors will go through the exploits of these vulnerabilities performed in a controlled lab environment by using various types of attack vectors, such as directory enumeration attacks and compromising EOL software versions, along with assessing at the size of the impact they can bring about when performed in real-life scenarios.

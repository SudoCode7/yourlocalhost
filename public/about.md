Donncha Ó Cearbhaill (IE/DE) is a hacker and security researcher. He is a leading expert on cybersecurity with a focus on targeted digital surveillance and other evolving threats facing journalists, activists, and other members of civil society. He leads the [Security Lab at Amnesty International](https://example.com/security-lab), which is focused on documenting and disrupting unlawful digital attacks targeting civil society.

With over a decade of experience in security and surveillance research, Donncha has conducted innovative and highly technical investigations to expose human rights abuses enabled by the mercenary cyber-surveillance industry.

In 2021, Donncha’s technical research was foundational to the award-winning [Pegasus Project](https://example.com/pegasus-project), an international journalistic collaboration that sparked one of the largest global surveillance scandals in recent history. This investigation led to a [European Parliament inquiry](https://example.com/eu-parliament-inquiry) into government spyware, legal actions from major tech companies, sanctions against the spyware vendor NSO Group, and numerous legal complaints from individuals whose phones were unlawfully hacked. The Pegasus Project earned the [European Parliament’s Daphne Caruana Galizia journalism prize](https://example.com/daphne-prize), a [George Polk Award](https://example.com/george-polk-award), and the [RSF Impact Prize](https://example.com/rsf-impact-prize).

Other investigations led by Donncha have identified critical privacy and security risks, such as vulnerabilities in COVID contact tracing apps used in Bahrain, Kuwait, and Norway. His work compelled the [Norwegian government](https://example.com/norwegian-gov) to shut down its initial app and adopt a privacy-by-design approach. His vulnerability research has also identified serious remote code execution vulnerabilities in widely used software such as [Ubuntu](https://example.com/ubuntu-vulnerabilities).
